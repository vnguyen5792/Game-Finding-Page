This was just a sample piece of code built while following along to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk&t=2107s
Since this is my first time messing around with React, I figured that this would be a good short introduction to it.  

**What have I learned from this**  
- that React is a cool and useful tool for reactive web development
- allows programmers to check the state of certain components and use passed-in properties
- That I will continue to keep trying to learn more React!!!
